# trent

Trent was intended to be a startup for sharing tools, travel and sports equipment, and much more. We canceled the project because of multiple reasons.

The basic functionality works, except payment, but we haven't got around to implement some nice-to-have functionality like a wishlist or bookmarks.

## trent-pwa

We first implemented an airbnb-like version, where people could upload items and other people could message them or create booking requests. To see this version, go to the branch old-version.

The current version works with booking requests, where people ask "can I borrow product X" and then people nearby with product X are notified.

You can check out the current version at: https://trentapp.com (though we might take the website down sometime)

If you like to run it on your own, after cloning the repo, run in the terminal (in the repo directory):

```
npm install
npm start
```

(Yarn might not work, I just used npm back then.)
